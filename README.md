This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) coding challenges. For those unfamiliar with Advent of Code, it is an annual event in which participants solve a series of coding challenges, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas.

I used this event as an opportunity to learn Rust, so the code in this repository may not be as idiomatic as you might expect.

I hope that my solutions may be useful to others as a reference or for inspiration.
